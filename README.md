#### Description:
This is a portfolio website for me to use someday. (As such, there are no actual projects or CV content yet!)

The static folder contains pictures used in the website (favicon, background and project pictures) and the css file, which contains styling for the entire website. The templates file contains all the html pages, including layout.html (boilerplate code) and all the pages that use it (cv, projects, and the homepage "index"). Outside these folders is app.py, which contains routes to the homepage, cv page, and projects page. The "requirements.txt" file lists the libraries used to make the website. The website was made using HTML, CSS, Flask, and Bootstrap.

I used:
- https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp for html/css help
- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH3tw9J9QyRrur30b9eDOtxh6yf4MqN5T to get started with bootstrap
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/ for bootstrap help

I wanted to have separate CV, projects, and home pages because as I accumulate work experience and make personal projects, I don't want my portfolio to become cluttered. I chose a grid layout for the projects page as opposed to a list because it's more space efficient and, in my opinion, more visually interesting to look at.

In future versions of this site, I want to add a "back-to-top" button and proper hamburger menu for the CV and projects pages. I want to make a hamburger menu similar to the one in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFKBep95lb4

I also want to add a contact link, such that when you hover over it or click it, it opens up a drawer of social media icons that hyperlink to my profiles. I want the drawer to open horizontally on the homepage and vertically in the hamburger menu.
