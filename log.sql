-- Keep a log of any SQL queries you execute as you solve the mystery.

-- 1. get ids and descriptions of events taking place on the date and location of the theft
SELECT id, description FROM crime_scene_reports WHERE year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND street = 'Humphrey Street';

-- | 161 | Ruth    | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.                                                          |
-- | 162 | Eugene  | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.

-- | 163 | Raymond | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket. |

-- 3. get license plates of cars leaving bakery around the time of the theft
SELECT license_plate, minute FROM bakery_security_logs WHERE year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND hour = 10 AND minute > 15 AND minute < 25 AND activity = 'exit';

-- 6. match caller to suspects and return name of remaining suspect(s):
SELECT DISTINCT(name) FROM people, phone_calls WHERE caller = phone_number AND year = 2021 AND day = 28 AND month = 7 AND duration < 60 AND license_plate IN (
    SELECT license_plate FROM bakery_security_logs WHERE year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND hour = 10 AND minute > 15 AND minute < 25 AND activity = 'exit'
    );

SELECT atm_transactions.account_number, bank_accounts.creation_year, people.name FROM atm_transactions, people, bank_accounts WHERE bank_accounts.person_id = people.id AND bank_accounts.account_number = atm_transactions.account_number AND year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND atm_location = 'Leggett Street' AND transaction_type = 'withdraw' AND people.name IN (SELECT DISTINCT(name) FROM people, phone_calls WHERE caller = phone_number AND year = 2021 AND day = 28 AND month = 7 AND duration < 60 AND license_plate IN (
    SELECT license_plate FROM bakery_security_logs WHERE year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND hour = 10 AND minute > 15 AND minute < 25 AND activity = 'exit'
    ));

-- 8. use remaining suspects from query 7 to get flight info
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE id = (
    SELECT flight_id FROM passengers, people WHERE passengers.passport_number = people.passport_number AND people.name IN (
        SELECT people.name FROM atm_transactions, people, bank_accounts WHERE bank_accounts.person_id = people.id AND bank_accounts.account_number = atm_transactions.account_number AND year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND atm_location = 'Leggett Street' AND transaction_type = 'withdraw' AND people.name IN (

                SELECT license_plate FROM bakery_security_logs WHERE year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND hour = 10 AND minute > 15 AND minute < 25 AND activity = 'exit'
            )
        )
    )
);

-- 9. check that origin airport is Fiftyville, meaning the person flying could have been the thief.
SELECT DISTINCT(city) FROM airports, flights WHERE origin_airport_id = 8 AND flights.origin_airport_id = airports.id;

-- 10. match passengers on flight from query 8 to names of remaining suspects
SELECT name FROM people, passengers WHERE flight_id = 18 AND people.passport_number = passengers.passport_number AND people.name IN ('Bruce', 'Diana');

-- 11. get destination of thief.

SELECT receiver FROM phone_calls, people WHERE duration < 60 AND year = 2021 AND day = 28 AND month = 7 AND caller = people.phone_number AND people.name = 'Diana';

-- 13. get the name of receiver.
SELECT name FROM people WHERE phone_number = (SELECT receiver FROM phone_calls, people WHERE duration < 60 AND year = 2021 AND day = 28 AND month = 7 AND caller = people.phone_number AND people.name = 'Diana');
